[parent] okay hogs, I've listened to you belly ache about moving to this new town, This said belly aching will end as of 15:30 hours, will not affect the morale of the squadron henceforth, do I make myself clear? 
[children] Yes sir.
[parent] I know it's rough to leave your friends and move every year, but you were marine kids and can chew nails while other kids are sucking cotton candy. And your Meechum's, Meechum's a thoroughbred a winner all away get's the best grades, wins the most awards and excels in sports. A Meechum never gives up. I want you hogs to let this burg know you're here. I want these crackers to wake up and wonder what the hell blew into town. Okay hogs, by nightfall I want this camp in inspection order. Do you read me loud and clear? 
[children] Yes sir. 
[parent] I said you read me loud and clear? 
[children] Yes sir. Outstanding, sergeant dismiss the troops.
[children] Dismissed. He does remind me of someone from the movies but it's not Rhett Butler. Who's that? Godzilla
