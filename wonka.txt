[child] I want you to be the first to find a golden ticket Daddy. 
[parent] I know Angel. We're doing the best we can. I've got every girl on the bleeding staff hunting for you. 
[child] All right where is it? Why haven't they found it? 
[parent] Veruca, sweetheart I'm not a magician, give me time. 
[child] I want it now. What's the matter with those twats down there? 
[parent] For 5 days now the entire flipping factory's been on the job. They haven't shelled a peanut in there since Monday. They've been shelling flaming chocolate bars from dawn to dusk.[child] Make them work nights. 
[parent] Come Along, come along you girls put a jerk in it or you'll be out your ears every one of you and listen to this, the first girl that finds a golden ticket gets A on pound bonus in their pay packet. What do you think of that? 
[child] They're not even trying, they don't want to find it. They're jealous of me.
[parent] Sweetheart, I can't push them no harder, 19,000 bars an hour thier shelling, 760,000 they have done so far. 
[child] You promised daddy you promised I'd have it the very first day.
[Parent] You're going to be very unpopular around here Henry, if you don't deliver soon.That breaks my heart Henrietta, I hate to see her unhappy. 
[child] I won't talk to you ever again, you're a rotten mean father you never give me anything I want and I won't go to school till I have it. 
[parent] Veruca,sweetheart, angel now there are only four tickets left in the whole world and the whole ruddy world's hunting for them. What can I do? 
I got it I got [Applause]
[child] It's about time too. I want it. Give me my ticket, mine I found the golden ticket.
